# ðŸ“˜ Project Charter: HabitWise (Habit Tracker with GUI)

## 1. Project Purpose / Problem Statement
Many people want to build better habits but lack a lightweight, distraction-free tool to track their progress. Most tools are bloated, require sign-ins, or overwhelm users with features. We aim to create a minimal, personal-use habit tracker that is easy to use, customizable, and built using Python with a simple GUI.

## 2. Goals and Objectives
- Build a local desktop application to track daily habits
- Provide a clean and intuitive GUI (Tkinter to start)
- Allow users to:
  - Add and edit habits
  - Mark habits as done for the day
  - View history/progress for each habit
- Persist data locally (using JSON or SQLite)

## 3. Scope
**In Scope:**
- Cross-platform Python GUI using Tkinter  
- Daily checklist view  
- Simple analytics (streaks, completion rate)  
- Local storage only  

**Out of Scope:**
- Syncing across devices  
- User accounts  
- Notifications or reminders  

## 4. Deliverables
- A working Python GUI app (Tkinter-based)
- `README.md` with setup instructions
- Optional: Export/import habit data (JSON)
